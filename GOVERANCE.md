# Governance

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers
- Maintainers are responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests, ensuring code quality, and managing the overall project direction.
- They are granted commit access and have the authority to make decisions about the project's future.

### Contributors
- Contributors are those who submit pull requests, report issues, or provide feedback. They play an essential role in improving the project.
- Contributors are encouraged to participate in discussions and contribute code or documentation.

### Core Team
- The Core Team is composed of maintainers and long-standing contributors. They have the final say on significant project decisions and strategic direction.

## Decision-Making Process
- For minor changes or bug fixes, maintainers can make decisions individually.
- For significant changes (new features, breaking changes), a consensus among the maintainers and the core team is required.
- In the event of disagreements, discussions should take place via issues, pull requests, or other communication channels until a consensus is reached.

## How to Become a Maintainer
- Contributors who have consistently contributed quality code and participated in discussions may be invited to become maintainers.
- The core team will evaluate potential maintainers based on their contributions, communication, and alignment with the project's goals.

## Meetings and Communication
- Major decisions will be discussed in public via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- Regular meetings may be held to discuss larger project changes, with minutes recorded and made available to the community.
